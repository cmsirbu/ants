            Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming
            language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data
            structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make
            it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for
            use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components
            together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes
            readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.
            Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program
            modularity and code reuse.
