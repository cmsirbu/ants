            Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic
            semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and
            dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as
            for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.
            Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces
            the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which
            encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the
            extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for
            all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.
