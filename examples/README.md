# ANTS Examples

This folder contains useful links and examples of things one can do with the libraries and
tools included in ANTS.

A local [vagrant powered lab](lab-vagrant) is here to allow for quick testing
against a bunch of interconnected virtual network devices: Juniper vQFX, Arista
vEOS and Cisco NXOS9000v.
